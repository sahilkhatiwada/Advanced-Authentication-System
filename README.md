# Advanced-Authentication-System
A secure user authentication solution with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), OAuth login (Google, Facebook), and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It includes session management with refresh tokens, password reset via email with secure tokens, and detailed audit logs for login attempts, ensuring top-notch security and user convenience.

### **1. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two types of verification before accessing their account.  
**How It Works:**
- After entering their password, the user is prompted to enter a code sent to their mobile device or email.
- Alternatively, the user can use an authentication app (e.g., Google Authenticator) to generate a time-based one-time password (TOTP).
- Only users who provide both their password and the 2FA code can log in successfully.

### **2. OAuth Integration (Google, Facebook, etc.)**
OAuth allows users to log in using their existing accounts on platforms like Google or Facebook instead of creating a new account.  
**How It Works:**
- The user clicks a "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Facebook" button.
- The application redirects the user to the provider's login page for authentication.
- Once authenticated, the provider sends back an authorization token containing the user's profile details.
- The application uses the token to log in or register the user securely.

**Benefits:**
- Faster signup/login process.
- Reduces password fatigue for users.

### **3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
RBAC assigns different levels of access and permissions to users based on their role within the application.  
**Example Roles:**
- **Admin:** Full access to all system features and data.
- **Manager:** Limited access to manage users or specific sections.
- **User:** Can only access their own data or certain features.

**How It Works:**
- Each user is assigned a role upon registration or by an admin.
- Middleware checks the user’s role before granting access to specific routes or features.
- Roles and permissions are managed dynamically, making the system flexible and scalable.

### **4. Session Management with Refresh Tokens**
Session management ensures users remain authenticated while reducing security risks.  
**How It Works:**
- Upon login, the server issues two tokens:
  1. **Access Token:** Short-lived (e.g., 15 minutes) and used for making API requests.
  2. **Refresh Token:** Long-lived (e.g., 7 days) and used to generate new access tokens.
- When the access token expires, the application automatically uses the refresh token to get a new access token without asking the user to log in again.
- Refresh tokens are stored securely (e.g., HTTP-only cookies).

**Benefits:**
- Enhances security by limiting token lifespan.
- Provides a seamless user experience without frequent logins.

### **5. Password Reset via Email with Secure Tokens**
This feature allows users to reset their password securely if they forget it.  
**How It Works:**
1. The user requests a password reset by entering their registered email.
2. The server generates a secure, time-limited token and sends it to the user’s email.
3. The user clicks a link containing the token, which redirects them to a reset password page.
4. The server verifies the token and allows the user to set a new password.

**Security Measures:**
- Tokens are hashed and stored in the database.
- Tokens expire after a specific period (e.g., 1 hour) to prevent misuse.

---

### **6. Audit Logs for Login Attempts**
Audit logs track all login-related activities to monitor user behavior and detect suspicious activities.  
**What It Tracks:**
- Successful logins: Date, time, and IP address.
- Failed login attempts: Number of attempts, reason for failure (e.g., incorrect password).
- Password reset requests and changes.

**How It Works:**
- Every login attempt is recorded in a database.
- Admins can access the logs via a dashboard to monitor user activities and identify potential security breaches.
- Alerts can be configured for suspicious behaviors, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP.

### **Tools and Technologies to Use**
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB for user data and token storage
- **Authentication:** Passport.js or custom JWT implementation
- **2FA:** Speakeasy (for TOTP) or integration with SMS/email APIs
- **OAuth:** Passport.js strategies for Google, Facebook, etc.
- **Email Sending:** Nodemailer or third-party services like SendGrid
- **Frontend:** React with Redux or Context API for state management

This system is robust, secure, and user-friendly, making it an excellent showcase of your MERN stack skills!
